<hr>
Linux users might find out, that setup does not run out of the box due to missing prerequisites - still testing
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/issues?state=closed" target="_blank">Issues might be posted here</a>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
The builds are run on Travis CI in the moment the changes are pushed to
<a href="https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>BE AWARE and TAKE CARE:</h3>
-- do not mix with a working SikuliX environment, use separate folders<br>
-- purge everything from environment that has something to do with previous SikuliX versions
-- run in a way, that your current installation and your work is safe or can be restored<br>
-- the stuff you get, might have any bugs without notice - so be prepared<br>
-- in addition to the fix information below, you might inspect the latest commits on
<a href="https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
<hr>
<a href="javadocs/index.html" target="_blank">View the corresponding JavaDocs of selected classes (relevant for API usage)</a>
<br><br>
<strong>BE AWARE</strong> Classes in the index, that do not open (error: not found, by intention)
<br>are not part of the official API, that is guaranteed to be downwards-compatible in version 2.
<br>Usage of these classes is at your own risk.<br>
For classes that open, all public elements can be expected to have the same feature and usage in version 2.
<br>Elements with remarks like "INTERNAL USE" or "EXPERIMENTAL" might not be available in version 2.
<br><hr>
If you want to use the latest nightly build <b>(sikulixapi.jar) in your Maven project:</b>
<br>it is available in the <b>OSSRH snapshot repository</b><br>
Add this appropriately to your pom:
<pre>
  &lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;sonatype-ossrh&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
  &lt;/repositories&gt;

  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;com.sikulix&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;sikulixapi&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.1.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
</pre>
<hr>
For setup the only file you need to download is <strong>sikulixsetup-1.1.2-#timestamp#.jar</strong>:
<br>
<br>
(download by clicking this link, store in an preferably empty folder and run by doubleclicking the jar)<br>
<a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/com/sikulix/sikulixsetup/1.1.2-SNAPSHOT/sikulixsetup-1.1.2-20170528.124903-28-forsetup.jar">sikulixsetup....jar</a><br>
(on Linux it might be necessary to switch on the executable file attribute)
<br>
<br>
this setup jar and the other jars look like this after download:<br>
sikulix...-1.1.2-YYYYMMDD.SSSSSS-NN-forsetup.jar or <br>
sikulix...-1.1.2-YYYYMMDD.SSSSSS-NN.jar<br>
DO NOT rename the files - leave them as they are!<br><br>
<br>
The files downloaded during setup are no longer stored in the folder setup is run in, but in a special Folder of your home folder:<br>
-- Windows: in the folder Sikulix in the folder pointed to by the environment variable %APPDATA%<br>
-- Mac: the folder ~/Library/Application Support/Sikulix<br>
-- Linux: in ~/.Sikulix<br>
Other folders stored there:<br>
-- the folder containing the native libraries (SikulixLibs_versionstamp/)<br>
-- the Lib folder containing the supporting stuff for Jython and JRuby (Lib/)<br>
-- the folder containing the tessdata stuff (SikulixTesseract/)<br>
only in case of problems it might be necessary to visit this folder.
<hr>
<br>
The needed jars will be downloaded automatically while running setup.<br>
The referenced downloadpages are:<br>
 -- <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/com/sikulix/" target="_blank">OSSRH Snapshot repository (browsable)</a><br>
 -- <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" target="_blank">MavenCentral repository (not browsable)</a><br>
 -- <a href="http://download.sikulix.com/tesseract-ocr-3.02.eng.tar.gz" target="_blank">tessdata default eng for setup (see below)</a>
 -- <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata" target="_blank">tessdata for all available languages</a>
<br>
<br>
So you only would need to manually download anything using the below links, if you have problems with setup's inline download.<br>
In this case you have to download the needed files according to the below information and run setup (so called offline setup)
<br>
If you download manually by clicking on the below links, the jars have to be moved either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- to a folder Downloads in the folder containing sikulixsetup-X.Y.Z.jar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- or to the same folder as sikulixsetup-X.Y.Z.jar<br>
<br>
Setup will find the local files and ask you wether to use them instead of downloading fresh versions.<br><br>
BE AWARE: These files are not useable for any other purpose than being processed by setup<br>
... and will be moved during setup into the Sikulix special folder down in your home folder (see above).<br>
In any case, when rerunning a setup, already downloaded files will always be detected and you are asked wether to reuse.
<br>
<hr>
<h4>for offline setup: downloads for setup option 1 (IDE)</h4>

<a href="http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scenarios.html#using-robotframework">see docs)</a><br>
<b>fixed:</b> ObserverCallback did not work in JRuby<br>
<a href="https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/pull/191">(thanks to https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/pull/191)</a><br>
<b>revised:</b> IDE: open/save/export/loadImage handling - now possible to load .skl into the IDE,
overwriting is checked at export, Folders not ending .sikuli can be loaded as scripts (with .py, .rb, .js)<br>

but only prints error messages and respective features will not work, also issuing error messages<br>
<b>added:</b> ScreenImage (return of capture()): getRegion() returns the region,
where the image was captured from<br>
<b>revised:</b> Python API layer for use with IDE's like PyCharm,

<b>revised:</b> Mac: App.isRunning() more robust now (no more strange crashes)<br>
<b>added:</b> popFile(): display a file open dialog allowing to select a file or folder
returning the absolute path to the selected item (Mac: script packages .sikuli can be entered)<br>
<b>revised:</b> the open/save/loadImage dialogs - Jython scripting support: <br>
... now possible to open a folder not having .sikuli (save not yet supported)<br>
... .skl can be opened to a .sikuli, to edit the script <br>
<b>fixed:</b> run(someCommand) now prints the complete output from stderr 
(not only first line) (Bug #1573519)<br>
<b>revised:</b> The target parameter type in find, wait, exists,findAll and onXXX is now checked for validity.<br>
... same goes for the respective indirect finds in click, ... (valid only: single Pattern, String, Image)<br>
... If invalid the script aborts with an error message reporting the line number in Jython scripts.<br>
<b>added:</b> class App: experimental: issue http requests based on Apache org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient 
(App.wwwStart(), App.wwwStop(), App.wwwGet(), App.wwwSave() see javadocs)<br>
<b>added:</b> FindFailed handler support: it is now possible, to define a handler function (as with observe), 
that is visited in case of FindFailed situations (before any other actions). 
A handler might also be specified for situations, that an image is not found on the imagepath (not loadable).
This new feature allows much easier, to implement corrective actions and logging for these cases.
How to finally handle the case can be specified in the handler. (see docs: Exception FindFailed)<br>
<b>revised:</b> FindFailed PROMPT: now an image can be recaptured in case of not found. This might make it easier, 
to make a script work in changed environments, where images are no longer found. 
The original image is preserved as _BACKUP_original.png. 
These backups have to be managed manually at this time and 
are overwritten without notice with the next recapture<br>
<b>added:</b> input and pop... features can now be placed on the screen where needed 
(center of the dialogbox goes to a given location or center of a region - 
related function is popat())<br>
<b>revised:</b> input, popup and the other pop... features now are always on top 
from beginning no matter which app is frontmost<br>
<b>revised:</b> Jython scripting support: possible now to setup a folder 
myscript (no .sikuli needed) containing a myscript.py, other .py files to be imported
and folders .sikuli intended to contain images.<br>
... This allows to setup projects in IDE's like PyCharm and 
run them from PyCharm as well as using SikuliX from commandline. <br>
... The image folders .sikuli are intended to be managed in the SikuliX IDE (capture support).<br>
About the prerequisites and the possibilities see the docs. 
This folder structure is not yet completely supported in the SikuliX IDE.
<h4>Build: 2016-03-26</h4>

and can have a sites.txt containing more paths (see docs/Using Python)
<h4>Build: 2015-06-22</h4>
revised: commandfiles on Mac to have alternatives to start the IDE (shows SikuliX icon in taskbar and SikuliX as name)<br>
revised: App class on Mac, still App.open() (app not running)
does not work on 10.9 and earlier (on 10.10 with most apps works),
when the script is run from the IDE that is running as SikuliX.app
- when starting the IDE or running script from commandline it works<br>
<h4>Build: 2015-06-15</h4>
fixed: Windows: Jython scripting: exceptions in imported stuff now again shown correctly
<h4>Build: 2015-05-28</h4>

so the App can be created with a window title and later be checked, whether it is running,
if other means are used to start the app (usage instead of "if someApp.window()")
<h4>Build: 2015-05-22</h4>
revised: class App: App.open() and openApp() now ignore already running instances of the named app and will in doubt start a new instance.
Windows: openApp("cmd.exe /c "some command to run") works again
<h4>Build: 2015-05-21</h4>

continued: RunServer and RunClient (now named Run)
<h4>Build: 2015-05-16</h4>
fixed: IDE: cursor keeps current position in cases, where the content is re-evaluated (toggle view and image rename)<br>
added: experimental (more options might follow):
a feature to highlight the search region before search (green frame)
and the match (if found, red frame) after the search (each for 2 seconds),
might be an alternative to slow motion running. Start: Debug.highlightOn(), Stop: Debug.highlightOff().
works for region.method() usage and for setROI() usage. The region/ROI must be at least 10 pixel smaller
than the screen on all sides, otherwise the green frame is omitted.
<h4>Build: 2015-05-15</h4>
fixed: multi monitor: should be fixed now (tested on Mac (incl. 10.10.x) and on Windows)<br>
revised: IDE: show button: now recognizes negative coordinates and finds image on all screens.<br>
added: class App: now possible to add parameters/options again as a string using setUsing(...). <br>
Currently only recognized on Windows, which brings back the possibility to <br>
open an application with parameters/options. <br>
Until now: App.open("some.exe parm1 parm2 ...") <br>
must now be written as App("some.exe").setUsing("parm1 parm2 ...").open()
<h4>Build: 2015-05-13</h4>
revised: class App: Mac/Windows: an app now knows it's process ID (PID) and its frontmost window title<br>
you can ask an app wether it is running and wether it has a window<br>
if an app is running it is not started again with open(). Linux: not yet revised
<h4>Build: 2015-05-08</h4>
revised: class App: App.open, focus, close on Windows to be more consistent.
getWindow() to get the title of the frontmost window of an app. The same app is only opened once -
a running process is reused.
<h4>Build: 2015-05-04</h4>
temp fix: IDE as mac app: added a hack to avoid click/type slowdown after about 60 seconds<br>
temp fixed: IDE: switching to Jython 2.7.0 final with setup option for Jython 2.5 (when unicode problems arise)
<h4>Build: 2015-05-01</h4>
added: IDE: buttons to capture a point and an offset and <br>
to show (highlight) the leftmost item in the line having the cursor (if possible in the line context)<br>
added: IDE: capturing with the cursor in a line containing only imagename = will result in an<br>
image filename as imagename.png and overwrites on recapture. (to support naming schemes and variable use)
<h4>Build: 2015-04-23</h4>
fixed: setup did not work anymore with already downloaded artefacts (offline setup)<br>
added: runScript(): inline run of PowerShell snippets
<h4>Build: 2015-04-20</h4>
added: runScript("applescript tell ..."): run code snippets in AppleScript on Mac using osascript<br>
fixed: possible problem with setup running with proxy<br>
revised: running Python scripts from net and with RunServer<br>
revised runsikulix.cmd: now first we check, whether java can be run from system path<br>
fixed: each SikuliX session should have it's own temp folder (auto deleted at JVM shutdown).
Still the IDE GUI can only run once, but as much as one likes in parallel from commandline.
<h4>Build: 2015-04-17</h4>
fixed: user args after -- not filled into sys.argv when running from commandline<br>
fixed: runsikulix.cmd did not use Java 8, if available in standard places<br>
fixed: tessdata not bundled when using setup with option 1 only<br>
fixed: exists(Pattern(image)) hangs (internally looping endlessly), if image file is not available<br>
added: experimental: RunServer: run scripts (or JavaScript snippets) from anywhere using a http RESTful protocol<br>
fixed: save script problems causing exceptions should be handled internally (otherwise might block GUI)<br>
added: experimental: visual annotation (former extension Guide) now a standard feature of SikuliX (contained in sikulixapi.jar)
<h4>Build: 2015-04-03</h4>
fixed: runScript(): possible NPE, when used in scripts run from commandline
<h4>Build: 2015-04-01</h4>
revised: jython script running with sikulixapi.jar::Runner: now returns the value from an exit(n)<br>
fixed: Linux: possible NPE in build on the fly
<h4>Build: 2015-03-31</h4>
added: jython script running with sikulixapi.jar::Runner: usage: org.sikuli.script.Runner.run(scriptPath, args),
sikulixapi.jar and a jython.jar must be on classpath (auto taken from setup downloads if omitted).
<h4>Build: 2015-03-27</h4>
fixed: Mac: a problem that made it to not run any longer with Java 6<br>
revised: MouseMovedCallback feature<br>
added: set callback handler and request visiting the handler before processing a mouse action (on/off)<br>
added: request termination with next mouse action throwing an AssertionError
<h4>Build: 2015-03-24</h4>
fixed: (I hope ;-) all regression bugs against 1.0.1 in multi monitor environments<br>
revised: ALL in Jython scripts and Screen.all().getRegion() can now be used, to search on all monitors in the same op
(ALL.click(someBotton) will find and click the button, no matter on which monitor it currently is)
<h4>Build: 2015-03-24</h4>
added: multi monitor: a visual can now be found on all screens with one op: Screen.all().getRegion().find(someImage)
will return a match, that knows it's screen, hence match.getScreen() will return the screen it was found on.
Take care: is a lengthy operation and costs some memory, so it should be used with care.
If the match spans screens, the screen with the biggest part is the winner (should be avoided).
<h4>Build: 2015-03-22</h4>
the next days I will somehow reveal more information about the new or revised features<br>
... but many features are already in the docs<br>
<br>
